# [done] - try with ChatGPT

- Data modelling via natural language using an LLM

OUTPUTs: (each is a different cli option or REST call)
- JSON
- SQL to create tables
- CSV test data
- SQL to insert test data

## To try:
- [done] Input as NL description of entities
- Input as DOT notation (could users use that?) - but then don’t need an LLM…

# LATER

## - try with Codex
## - try with other LLM
